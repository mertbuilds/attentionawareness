/**
 * One layout gathering into another: the header's open strip into its pill
 * and back. `update` changes the layout at once; the items marked
 * `data-morph` inside `root` then move from where they stood to where they
 * now stand, and `surface`, the ground drawn behind them, grows or shrinks
 * from its old box to its new one.
 *
 * The motion follows the transitions.dev scale. Gathering into the pill is
 * the surface opening: it takes `verySlow`, and the items set off a
 * `stagger` apart, in the order they stand. Opening back out is the close:
 * quicker, at `slow`, and all at once. Both travel on `smoothOut`. An item
 * with no place on the other side is a word going or coming: it fades out
 * and blurs at `quick` as the motion starts, or fades in from a blur at
 * `quick` as it ends, so it never stands under an item passing it.
 *
 * Where the browser has view transitions, the items are carried by one; each
 * `data-morph` is also its `view-transition-name`. Elsewhere they are moved
 * by hand, and an item that is gone leaves a copy where it stood to fade.
 * The surface is not a snapshot in either case: it stays live, so the page
 * blurs through it the whole way. With less motion, the layout only changes.
 *
 * An item that changes shape between the two layouts is passed as `live` and
 * is no snapshot either. A view transition can only fade one picture of an
 * item into another, and a square fading into a circle reads as a blink, not
 * as a change of shape. A live item is moved and resized by hand instead, as
 * the surface is, and its corners go from the old radius to the new one over
 * the same motion, so it is one shape the whole way.
 *
 * A view transition eases each step of its own keyframes as well, which on
 * top of the pace hurries the items. Gathering, that brings them in ahead of
 * the surface closing around them. Opening back out it would fling them past
 * the surface's edges before it has opened, and leave the surface sweeping
 * out after they have stopped. So that transition is given a type, and
 * `app.css` takes the ease off by it: the pace is then the whole motion, as
 * it is for the surface. There every picture also holds its last frame until
 * the transition is gone, so the live items take over exactly as they stand.
